* Avoid lossing precision when scaling frequencies

Classes in pulse_instruction.py scale frequency values to GHz by
multipliying `ParameterExpression` with float 1e9. This can lead
to numerical errors on some systems using symengine. Instead, this
scaling can be done multiplying by integer 10**9.

* added new method, deterministic helper unction

added new method probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings, moved logic from probabilities_dict to probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings with ability to pass target, probabilities_dict will pass a target of None.

* Adding test timing, fixed algorithm for determining if should get probability for qubit

Added some timing of the tests to determine if the version with a specfic target runs faster then the non-targetted version (which must calculate all 2^n possibilities for stabilizer state test_probablities_dict_single_qubit. When given a target it can skip branches that were not wanting to be calculated

* Adding more tests, fixing deterministic issues with bad target

* Prob of targets with 0.0 probability

* target calc changes

* Simpler way to get all targets

* Need to improve performance with multiple targets

* Simplified the probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings method

simplified the method probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings, less checking was needed, simpler handling of no target value passed in

* Adding tests for targets

* Added tests to test_probablities_dict_qubits

* Add performance boost check when using targets for test_probablities_dict_qubits

* Added Caching to prevent duplicate branch calculations

In stabilizerstate, added the ability to cache previously calculated branches so they do not get recalculated when attempting to get target values, gives a better starting point to calculate from instead of starting from an unknown probability value of 1.0

* improve performance by performing expensive operations only when needed

when creating an array for the outcome in probability, it is only built if the cache key is not found

* Optimization for caching, deterministic calcs for branches, enabling/disabling cache

added more optimization for performance when performing calculations for branches using caching and targets, it will now also store the deterministic node values which gives a very slight performance increase, migrated to most efficient ways to store and retrieve cache values. The performance increase when using a large amount of qubits is huge, when using a very small amount of qubits the very slight over head of caching makes it about the same. Increasing test coverage for using targets with probabilities

* improved tests, checking of caching vs not caching

implemented more accurate tests that verify probability caching

* added more tests and variations for stabilizerstate

* Corrected deterministic probability calculations

* Fixed bug with cache in wrong place for some calculations

for some calculations the cached results were in the wrong place which could cause false results for certain test cases with 3+ qubits

* added more test cases

* Probabilities update for moved method call

* Added test for random test_probs_random_subsystem

* fixed single probabilities tests lost in previous merge

* Removed caching of deterministic values

overhead was too high compared to calculating

* Fixed failing test with test_probs_random_subsystem

Fixed failing test that would randomly occur, the stabilizer state was not being cached as well, which would sometimes produce a failure. After caching the object to restore when calculating starting at a node down the branch, this failure no longer occurs. Need to optimize and clean up the code a bit, but functioning

* Adding tests back that were not test_probs_random_subsystem, removed to test

* Created ProbabilityCache object for dealing with caching

* Added GC disabling between timed tests

* Attempting using perf_counter_ns instead of process_time_ns

* Updated commenting, moved 'X' outcome check

moved 'X' in outcome out of the for loop for StabilizerState._get_probabilities to help performance

* more comment updating

* Changed performance timer based on OS type

* Changing to time.thread_time_ns(), and raising performance varabilitiy by 0.005

using time.thread_time_ns() for benchmarking instead of time.perf_counter_ns() and time.process_time_ns() based on the OS in test_stabilizerstate. It seems that time is being counted that shouldn't be with the other methods that causes false reports of the work taking longer then it does. Raising the performance_varability_percent in test_stablilizerstate by 0.005 to 0.01 for more headroom for performance checking

* changing time.thread_time() vs time.thread_time_ns() to see if compatible with windows

also added one more target for test_4 to differentiate no caching against caching in test_stabilizerstate

* Changing performance timer based on OS for test_stablizerstate

perf_counter_ns for win32 and thread_time for all other OS

* fixed small issue in probabilitycache, improved probabilitycache test

fixed issue when checking the cache key that was not operating correctly, internally the key is always a str, but when a list[str] was passed in the check was not correct, so changed to check if an instance of a list, and will join the outcome val to a str for the internal cache key. Improved the probabilitycache to test having alternating keys of str and list[str] to test this internal key checking

* Added correct type hinting to probabilitycache

* removed typing hint module

removed the use of typing module for type hinting, looks like python wants to get away from using this module for type hinting, also fixed some commenting issues in stabilizerstate, test_probabilitycache, test_stabilizerstate, and probabilitycache files

* Fix test pylint failure of Value 'list' is unsubscriptable (unsubscriptable-object)

fixing tests failing with pylint when lint checking is performed. This worked locally and wasn't failing, but when it runs in the CI/CD process it fails, so adding from __future__ import annotations to avoid this failure for test_probabilitycache and test_stabilizerstate as new tests include type hinting

* Fix small comment error in test, Added use_caching to tests, simplified cache calls

Fixed a small error in my commenting for the test_stabilizerstate.py and forced use_caching parm in the call of probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings in the tests, even tho it is used as default, to make sure it is clear in the tests. Simplfied the adding values to Probabilitycache, and simplified the code in StabilizerState._get_probabilities() setting values in cache and retrieving the state when using cache, made cache_key in probabilitycache ""private"" and changed method to _cache_key

* Significant code refactoring in StabiizerState

Significant code refactoring in stabilizerstate. I was able to condense the use the cache to a smaller area in the _get_probabilities helper method so it is easier to work with and more clear. I removed methods I created that were single use helper methods that were able to be condensed down into simpler code such as _branches_to_measure, _retrieve_deterministic_probability, _branches_to_measure, _is_qubit_deterministic. Since these are 1 time use methods it didn't make sense to keep them around. The _get_probabilities helper method is much simpler and clearer, closer to the original with less tweaks and functioning with the same performance, and more clarity.  Most of the code changed at this point is adding tests, most of this commit was removing unnecessary code and refactoring

* Fixed stabilizerstate cache key outcome not found

there was a check to make sure a key could be found before that was removed in the refactoring, once and awhile you get a target that can't be found in the cache because of the algorithm of looking for a key by increasing the number of X from the left to the right. There are situations where the X would be in the middle such as 0X1 that won't be found. The algorithm in the probability cache could be changed to use BST which would very rarely help performance, the fix is to make sure a key can be found and then only use the cache if that is the case

* Moved all caching retrieval outside of _get_probabilities for performance

there is a slight overhead when recursively iterating through the _get_probabilities helper when having to check if caching should be retrieved. Realistically when you use caching it is just to get you a better starting point, so it only needs to be retrieved once. The cache inserting remains in the _get_probabilities helper to build up the cache, but the logic was significantly simplified in the _get_probabilities helper, and now only a 1 time cache retrieval is performed for each target via the probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings method

* Simplified Bitstring method for probability cache, removed unnecessary classes

Removed Probabilitycache class, test_probabilitiycache.py. Simplified test_stabilizerstate.py for new bitstring probability testing methods. changed method probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings to probabilities_dict_from_bitstring, and simplified by removing cache, and only allowing a single string value to be passed in

* Commenting update for _probabilities_bitstring_verify

updating the commenting for _probabilities_bitstring_verify, move to top of file

* black lint formatter ran

* Uncomment out line causing circular import

when running locally I get a circular import for two_qubit_decompose.py on line 154 ""_specializations = two_qubit_decompose.Specialization"", I need to comment out to test locally, but did not mean to commit this.

Simplified the stablizierstate self._get_probabilities method but removing an unnecessary check

* Remove type hints from test_stabilizerstate

* Updated test_stabilizerstate, removed helper test method, new release note

update the tests in test_stabilizerstate to no longer use a helper method for checking all the bitstring measurements in. Created a _get_probabilities_dict helper method in stabilizer state to be used for the probabilities_dict and probabilities_dict_with_bitstring methods. This was needed so that they could share the logic of the measurements, but also so that you could enforce in the probabilities_dict_with_bitstring method that outcome_bitstring must be provided. Previouslly this was optional and the user could avoid passing in a value, but this would essentially make it function the same as probabilities_dict. Now with the helper it enforces they must provide a bitstring

* Added large qubit test with h gates, reorder imports for test_stabilizerstate

added new test method test_probabilities_dict_large_num_qubits with large amount of qubit tests using an outcome bitstring target, num_qubits=[25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 750], normally get any results for 750 qubits would require ~5.922387e+225 full bitstring calculations, but if you want one target bitstring you can perform ~750 measurements for a single probability for one result and get the value quickly

* moved methods out of loop that are unnecessary in test_stabilizerstate

moded target dict calculation out of loop that is not necessary to recalculate through each sample loop calculation

* broke out medium hgate test to own test method, issue with assertTrue type in test

testing a variety of hgates that also do the full probabilities_dict calculations up to 9 qubits called test_probabilities_dict_hgate_medium_num_qubits, also changed a assertTrue typo to assertDictEqual in the test_probabilities_dict_large_num_qubits method

* fixed commenting in stabilizerstate, removed unnecessary outcome_bitstring array access syntax

fixed some commenting for probabilities_dict_from_bitstring, and removed unnecessary syntax for accessing the array, was outcome_bitstring[i : i + 1] now outcome_bitstring[i] in _get_probabilities

* Condensed tests in test_stabilizerstate, added helper test class, more test coverage

added class StabilizerStateTestingTools in file test_stabilizerstate, these methods needed to be moved outside of the TestStabilizerState class because they are also needed in the TestStabilizerStateExpectationValue class within the file. It did not make sense to put these helper methods in the QiskitTestCase class, or the BaseQiskitTestCase class as these helpers are specific to helping test a new method in the stabilizerstate class.

I condensed redudnant code for checking the individual bitstrings into helper method _verify_individual_bitstrings which takes a target dict, uses each entry in the dict to attempt to get the single probability, and verify each, which drastically raises the test coverage of this new method probabilities_dict_from_bitstring.

added helper method StabilizerStateTestingTools._bitstring_product which builds a dict of the product of 0, 1 for a lenth passed in, used in several test cases for testing the zero probabilities.

In the test cases you will also notice cases where I update the target dict target.update(StabilizerStateTestingTools._bitstring_product( num_qubits, target)), which builds the rest of the bitstring values that will have a 0 probability, which is then passed into the _verify_individual_bitstrings method to verify they get the correct 0 value

I reduced the number of qubits for the test_probabilities_dict_hgate_large_num_qubits from tests of num_qubits=[25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 750] to num_qubits=[25, 50, 100, 200] due to memory issues on windows, and the largest use case I have received so far is 100 qubits, so going above that by 2x

Overall test coverage should be dramatically increased now testing for 0 probabilities, checking every bitstring individually has a probability, and simplifying the code, removing a lot of repetative logic, moved to the helper methods

It seems that time is being counted that shouldn't be with the other methods that causes false reports of the work taking longer then it does. Raising the performance_varability_percent in test_stablilizerstate by 0.005 to 0.01 for more headroom for performance checking

* changing time.thread_time() vs time.thread_time_ns() to see if compatible with windows

also added one more target for test_4 to differentiate no caching against caching in test_stabilizerstate

* Changing performance timer based on OS for test_stablizerstate

perf_counter_ns for win32 and thread_time for all other OS

* fixed small issue in probabilitycache, improved probabilitycache test

fixed issue when checking the cache key that was not operating correctly, internally the key is always a str, but when a list[str] was passed in the check was not correct, so changed to check if an instance of a list, and will join the outcome val to a str for the internal cache key. Improved the probabilitycache to test having alternating keys of str and list[str] to test this internal key checking

* Added correct type hinting to probabilitycache

* removed typing hint module

removed the use of typing module for type hinting, looks like python wants to get away from using this module for type hinting, also fixed some commenting issues in stabilizerstate, test_probabilitycache, test_stabilizerstate, and probabilitycache files

* Fix test pylint failure of Value 'list' is unsubscriptable (unsubscriptable-object)

fixing tests failing with pylint when lint checking is performed. This worked locally and wasn't failing, but when it runs in the CI/CD process it fails, so adding from __future__ import annotations to avoid this failure for test_probabilitycache and test_stabilizerstate as new tests include type hinting

* Fix small comment error in test, Added use_caching to tests, simplified cache calls

Fixed a small error in my commenting for the test_stabilizerstate.py and forced use_caching parm in the call of probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings in the tests, even tho it is used as default, to make sure it is clear in the tests. Simplfied the adding values to Probabilitycache, and simplified the code in StabilizerState._get_probabilities() setting values in cache and retrieving the state when using cache, made cache_key in probabilitycache ""private"" and changed method to _cache_key

* Significant code refactoring in StabiizerState

Significant code refactoring in stabilizerstate. I was able to condense the use the cache to a smaller area in the _get_probabilities helper method so it is easier to work with and more clear. I removed methods I created that were single use helper methods that were able to be condensed down into simpler code such as _branches_to_measure, _retrieve_deterministic_probability, _branches_to_measure, _is_qubit_deterministic. Since these are 1 time use methods it didn't make sense to keep them around. The _get_probabilities helper method is much simpler and clearer, closer to the original with less tweaks and functioning with the same performance, and more clarity.  Most of the code changed at this point is adding tests, most of this commit was removing unnecessary code and refactoring

* Fixed stabilizerstate cache key outcome not found

there was a check to make sure a key could be found before that was removed in the refactoring, once and awhile you get a target that can't be found in the cache because of the algorithm of looking for a key by increasing the number of X from the left to the right. There are situations where the X would be in the middle such as 0X1 that won't be found. The algorithm in the probability cache could be changed to use BST which would very rarely help performance, the fix is to make sure a key can be found and then only use the cache if that is the case

* Moved all caching retrieval outside of _get_probabilities for performance

there is a slight overhead when recursively iterating through the _get_probabilities helper when having to check if caching should be retrieved. Realistically when you use caching it is just to get you a better starting point, so it only needs to be retrieved once. The cache inserting remains in the _get_probabilities helper to build up the cache, but the logic was significantly simplified in the _get_probabilities helper, and now only a 1 time cache retrieval is performed for each target via the probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings method

* Simplified Bitstring method for probability cache, removed unnecessary classes

Removed Probabilitycache class, test_probabilitiycache.py. Simplified test_stabilizerstate.py for new bitstring probability testing methods. changed method probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings to probabilities_dict_from_bitstring, and simplified by removing cache, and only allowing a single string value to be passed in

* Commenting update for _probabilities_bitstring_verify

updating the commenting for _probabilities_bitstring_verify, move to top of file

* black lint formatter ran

* Uncomment out line causing circular import

when running locally I get a circular import for two_qubit_decompose.py on line 154 ""_specializations = two_qubit_decompose.Specialization"", I need to comment out to test locally, but did not mean to commit this.

Simplified the stablizierstate self._get_probabilities method but removing an unnecessary check

* Remove type hints from test_stabilizerstate

* Updated test_stabilizerstate, removed helper test method, new release note

update the tests in test_stabilizerstate to no longer use a helper method for checking all the bitstring measurements in. Created a _get_probabilities_dict helper method in stabilizer state to be used for the probabilities_dict and probabilities_dict_with_bitstring methods. This was needed so that they could share the logic of the measurements, but also so that you could enforce in the probabilities_dict_with_bitstring method that outcome_bitstring must be provided. Previouslly this was optional and the user could avoid passing in a value, but this would essentially make it function the same as probabilities_dict. Now with the helper it enforces they must provide a bitstring

* Added large qubit test with h gates, reorder imports for test_stabilizerstate

added new test method test_probabilities_dict_large_num_qubits with large amount of qubit tests using an outcome bitstring target, num_qubits=[25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 750], normally get any results for 750 qubits would require ~5.922387e+225 full bitstring calculations, but if you want one target bitstring you can perform ~750 measurements for a single probability for one result and get the value quickly

* moved methods out of loop that are unnecessary in test_stabilizerstate

moded target dict calculation out of loop that is not necessary to recalculate through each sample loop calculation

* broke out medium hgate test to own test method, issue with assertTrue type in test

testing a variety of hgates that also do the full probabilities_dict calculations up to 9 qubits called test_probabilities_dict_hgate_medium_num_qubits, also changed a assertTrue typo to assertDictEqual in the test_probabilities_dict_large_num_qubits method

* fixed commenting in stabilizerstate, removed unnecessary outcome_bitstring array access syntax

fixed some commenting for probabilities_dict_from_bitstring, and removed unnecessary syntax for accessing the array, was outcome_bitstring[i : i + 1] now outcome_bitstring[i] in _get_probabilities

* Condensed tests in test_stabilizerstate, added helper test class, more test coverage

added class StabilizerStateTestingTools in file test_stabilizerstate, these methods needed to be moved outside of the TestStabilizerState class because they are also needed in the TestStabilizerStateExpectationValue class within the file. It did not make sense to put these helper methods in the QiskitTestCase class, or the BaseQiskitTestCase class as these helpers are specific to helping test a new method in the stabilizerstate class.

I condensed redudnant code for checking the individual bitstrings into helper method _verify_individual_bitstrings which takes a target dict, uses each entry in the dict to attempt to get the single probability, and verify each, which drastically raises the test coverage of this new method probabilities_dict_from_bitstring.

added helper method StabilizerStateTestingTools._bitstring_product which builds a dict of the product of 0, 1 for a lenth passed in, used in several test cases for testing the zero probabilities.

In the test cases you will also notice cases where I update the target dict target.update(StabilizerStateTestingTools._bitstring_product( num_qubits, target)), which builds the rest of the bitstring values that will have a 0 probability, which is then passed into the _verify_individual_bitstrings method to verify they get the correct 0 value

I reduced the number of qubits for the test_probabilities_dict_hgate_large_num_qubits from tests of num_qubits=[25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 750] to num_qubits=[25, 50, 100, 200] due to memory issues on windows, and the largest use case I have received so far is 100 qubits, so going above that by 2x

Overall test coverage should be dramatically increased now testing for 0 probabilities, checking every bitstring individually has a probability, and simplifying the code, removing a lot of repetative logic, moved to the helper methods

Qiskit,qiskit,test/python/quantum_info/states/test_stabilizerstate.py,"Add new method for single bitstring target when measuring stabilizerstate probabilities_dict (#12147)

* added new method, deterministic helper unction

added new method probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings, moved logic from probabilities_dict to probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings with ability to pass target, probabilities_dict will pass a target of None.

* Adding test timing, fixed algorithm for determining if should get probability for qubit

Added some timing of the tests to determine if the version with a specfic target runs faster then the non-targetted version (which must calculate all 2^n possibilities for stabilizer state test_probablities_dict_single_qubit. When given a target it can skip branches that were not wanting to be calculated

* Adding more tests, fixing deterministic issues with bad target

* Prob of targets with 0.0 probability

* target calc changes

* Simpler way to get all targets

* Need to improve performance with multiple targets

* Simplified the probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings method

simplified the method probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings, less checking was needed, simpler handling of no target value passed in

* Adding tests for targets

* Added tests to test_probablities_dict_qubits

* Add performance boost check when using targets for test_probablities_dict_qubits

* Added Caching to prevent duplicate branch calculations

In stabilizerstate, added the ability to cache previously calculated branches so they do not get recalculated when attempting to get target values, gives a better starting point to calculate from instead of starting from an unknown probability value of 1.0

* improve performance by performing expensive operations only when needed

when creating an array for the outcome in probability, it is only built if the cache key is not found

* Optimization for caching, deterministic calcs for branches, enabling/disabling cache

added more optimization for performance when performing calculations for branches using caching and targets, it will now also store the deterministic node values which gives a very slight performance increase, migrated to most efficient ways to store and retrieve cache values. The performance increase when using a large amount of qubits is huge, when using a very small amount of qubits the very slight over head of caching makes it about the same. Increasing test coverage for using targets with probabilities

* improved tests, checking of caching vs not caching

implemented more accurate tests that verify probability caching

* added more tests and variations for stabilizerstate

* Corrected deterministic probability calculations

* Fixed bug with cache in wrong place for some calculations

for some calculations the cached results were in the wrong place which could cause false results for certain test cases with 3+ qubits

* added more test cases

* Probabilities update for moved method call

* Added test for random test_probs_random_subsystem

* fixed single probabilities tests lost in previous merge

* Removed caching of deterministic values

overhead was too high compared to calculating

* Fixed failing test with test_probs_random_subsystem

Fixed failing test that would randomly occur, the stabilizer state was not being cached as well, which would sometimes produce a failure. After caching the object to restore when calculating starting at a node down the branch, this failure no longer occurs. Need to optimize and clean up the code a bit, but functioning

* Adding tests back that were not test_probs_random_subsystem, removed to test

* Created ProbabilityCache object for dealing with caching

* Finished adding ProbabilityCache object and commenting

* Added more documentation for stabilizer state

* Fixing style with tox -eblack

* commenting fixes in stabilizerstate

* Added release note

* Updated release notes

* added __future__ to probabilitiescache, removed unused import stabilizerstate

fixed lint issues in test_probabilitiycache, test_stabilizerstate, stabilizerstate, and probabilitycache

* fixed more pylint lint issues

pylint -rn qiskit test tools
Corrected in probabilitycache, stabilizerstate, test_probabilitycach, test_stabilizerstate

* fixed more lint issues

fixed with:
tox -eblack

verified with:
black --check qiskit test tools examples setup.py
pylint -rn qiskit test tools
tox -elint

* added a bit more variance allowance for performance tests

renamed test_probabilitycache.py file to correct spelling
added a bit more performance_varability_percent percent time allowed from 0.001 to 0.005

* Corrected Lint issues, added test for probabilitycache

added test_probabilitycache test, fixed lint issues and type issues in stabilizerstate, test_stabilizerstate

* Fixed remaining import ordering issue

* readded ddt decorator for test_probabilitycache

* Changed to using process_time_ns from monotonic for performance measuring

* Added output when performance times fail to aid in debugging in test_stabilizerstate

* moved performance end time out of same method to calculate times

* changed method name in test_stabilizerstate

changed probability_percent_of_calculated_branches to _probability_percent_of_calculated_branches

* Added GC disabling between timed tests

* Attempting using perf_counter_ns instead of process_time_ns

* Updated commenting, moved 'X' outcome check

moved 'X' in outcome out of the for loop for StabilizerState._get_probabilities to help performance

* more comment updating

* Changed performance timer based on OS type

* Changing to time.thread_time_ns(), and raising performance varabilitiy by 0.005

using time.thread_time_ns() for benchmarking instead of time.perf_counter_ns() and time.process_time_ns() based on the OS in test_stabilizerstate. It seems that time is being counted that shouldn't be with the other methods that causes false reports of the work taking longer then it does.

### Summary

This removes many sections of the documentation that refer to the
metapackage as a whole, the elements of the metapackage, or refer to
Terra as Terra. This is intended to be in line with the new branding
decisions around the Qiskit project.

With the current community management structure still a little up in the
air, we are (at least temporarily) removing the repository-decision
flowchart from the documentation, since this documentation will
primarily be for Qiskit Terra. The contributor flowchart, or something
similar, may end up on the landing pages of the Ecosystem documentation,
or another community hub.

### Details and comments

I've left references to ""Terra"" in place, because those should still
logically be removed as part of the general migration in naming within
the Terra repository. I've also left the build processes in place that
`git clone` Terra and the tutorials; we need those to continue having a
working docs build in this repo. They'll get modified as these files get
merge to Terra as well, but they need to stay alive here.

One of the notable removals is the API docs links to Aer and IBMQ from
the main page, since as of the deployed metapackage version (0.44),
those are no longer part of the metapackage.

Fix #1787.
Fix #1778 - mostly; the version logic is _way_ stripped down, and will
now automatically work on Terra at least as much as we need when the
files are merged.
Fix #1667 
Fix #1643"

""density matrix"" in `plot_state_city` and
`plot_state_hinton` fotutorials/circuits/2_plotting_data_in_qiskit.html.
Additionally I have also changed it at other plot functions.


### Details and comments
""State matrix"" has a different physical meaning and doesn't go with the
definition given in the documentation. Hence ""density matrix"" seems like
a better option to use instead of ""state matrix"".

Fixing layer description in ""Implementing a BasicMapper Pass""


### Details and comments
Original sentence stated ""each layer is a group of operations that does
not act on independent qubits, so in theory all operations in a layer
can be done independently"", which is incorrect. Every layer is a group
of operations specifically acting on separate qubits each. The new
sentence clarifies that with ""each layer is a group of operations acting
on independent qubits...""

### Summary

Quick change to Grover's Algorithm tutorial to clarify that
`optimal_num_iterations` is designed for the uniform superposition and
not general state preparations.

Change was inspired by [this Quantum Computing StackExchange
question](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/32951/find-the-number-of-iterations-for-amplitude-amplification-to-get-the-correct-sta).

PennyLaneAI,pennylane,pennylane/_qubit_device.py,"Eigvals are floats (#5607)

**Context:**
Most eigvals are floats, but specifically for X, Y, Z and Hadamard, they
have been (1, -1). This can make trouble - for example, it caused an
issue with JAX-JIT, because it doesn't know what dtype to anticipate
coming from a sampled observable.

**Description of the Change:**
Main change here is changing eigvals to (1.0, -1.0) so that all
observables have the same dtype for eigenvalues.
There is still some special handling for X, Y, Z and Hadamard, because
it makes things JIT compatible for those operators, but it now pulls
from the `op.eigvals()` property and returns floats.

**Benefits:**

- Sampling of observables is more consistent in how it is processed and
what dtype is returned
- JAX-JIT with samples and an observable works now, see linked issue
below

**Possible Drawbacks:**
If people were doing checks for `int`, or otherwise assuming they would
get integers when returning fx. `qml.sample(qml.X(0))`, this will be a
breaking change for them.

get integers when returning fx. `qml.sample(qml.X(0))`, this will be a

PennyLaneAI,pennylane,tests/tape/test_tape.py,"Eigvals are floats (#5607)

**Context:**
Most eigvals are floats, but specifically for X, Y, Z and Hadamard, they
have been (1, -1). This can make trouble - for example, it caused an
issue with JAX-JIT, because it doesn't know what dtype to anticipate
coming from a sampled observable.

**Description of the Change:**
Main change here is changing eigvals to (1.0, -1.0) so that all
observables have the same dtype for eigenvalues.
There is still some special handling for X, Y, Z and Hadamard, because
it makes things JIT compatible for those operators, but it now pulls
from the `op.eigvals()` property and returns floats.

**Benefits:**

- Sampling of observables is more consistent in how it is processed and
what dtype is returned
- JAX-JIT with samples and an observable works now, see linked issue
below

**Possible Drawbacks:**
If people were doing checks for `int`, or otherwise assuming they would
get integers when returning fx. `qml.sample(qml.X(0))`, this will be a
breaking change for them.

PennyLaneAI,pennylane,doc/releases/changelog-dev.md,"Add kwargs for equal functions (#5668)

### Before submitting

Please complete the following checklist when submitting a PR:

- [x] All new features must include a unit test.
If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add a test to
the
      test directory!

- [x] All new functions and code must be clearly commented and
documented.
If you do make documentation changes, make sure that the docs build and
      render correctly by running `make docs`.

- [x] Ensure that the test suite passes, by running `make test`.

- [x] Add a new entry to the `doc/releases/changelog-dev.md` file,
summarizing the
      change, and including a link back to the PR.

- [x] The PennyLane source code conforms to
      [PEP8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
We check all of our code against [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/).
      To lint modified files, simply `pip install pylint`, and then
      run `pylint pennylane/path/to/file.py`.

When all the above are checked, delete everything above the dashed
line and fill in the pull request template.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Context:**
The kwargs (`check_interface`, `check_trainability`, `atol` and `rtol`)
were not available for `_equal_pow`, `_equal_adjoint`, `_equal_exp` and
`_equal_sprod`, which are overrides of `qml.equal`. Therefore,
comparisons that allowed for interfacing and numerical errors were not
possible.

**Description of the Change:**
Changed to allow kwargs to be used in override of `qml.equal`.

**Benefits:**
The following interfaces and comparisons with tolerance for numerical
errors are possible.

```
>>> op1 = qml.RX(1.2, wires=0)
>>> op2 = qml.RX(1.2 + 1e-4, wires=0)
>>> qml.equal(op1 **2, op2 ** 2, atol=1e-3)

**HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE**

**Context:**

To improve integration with catalyst, we want a way to be able to
natively capture the creation of quantum operations into an intermediate
representation. This is one of the early PR's for this experimental
push.

**Description of the Change:**

This PR adds a `PLXPR` metaclass that `Operator` uses. This allows for
the capture of all `Operator` classes into jaxpr.


```python
qml.capture.enable_plxpr()

def qfunc(a):
    qml.X(0)
    qml.IsingXX(a, wires=range(2))
    qml.ctrl(qml.adjoint(qml.X(0)), 1)

    0.5 * qml.X(0) @ qml.Y(1) + qml.Z(2)
    
jaxpr = jax.make_jaxpr(qfunc)(0)
jaxpr
```

```
{ lambda ; a:i32[]. let
    _:AbstractOperator() = PauliX[n_wires=1] 0
    _:AbstractOperator() = IsingXX[n_wires=2] a 0 1
    b:AbstractOperator() = PauliX[n_wires=1] 0
    c:AbstractOperator() = Adjoint b
    _:AbstractOperator() = Controlled[control_values=None work_wires=None] c 1
    d:AbstractOperator() = PauliX[n_wires=1] 0
    e:AbstractOperator() = SProd[id=None] 0.5 d
    f:AbstractOperator() = PauliY[n_wires=1] 1
    g:AbstractOperator() = Prod[id=None] e f
    h:AbstractOperator() = PauliZ[n_wires=1] 2
    _:AbstractOperator() = Sum[grouping_type=None id=None method=rlf] g h
  in () }
```

We can also return the jaxpr to normal pennylane qfunc behaviour via
`jax.core.eval_jaxpr`:

```python
with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q:
    jax.core.eval_jaxpr(jaxpr.jaxpr, jaxpr.consts, 0.1)

[X(0),
 IsingXX(0.1, wires=[0, 1]),
 Controlled(Adjoint(X(0)), control_wires=[1]),
 (0.5 * X(0)) @ Y(1) + Z(2)]
```

**Benefits:**

**Possible Drawbacks:**

* Metaprogramming in python is an edge skill, and often not the best way
to solve a problem. Messing around with things like this can often have
unintended consequences down the line.

* With PLXPR, wires will be restricted to be jax-tracable friendly
labels.

**Benefits:**

**Possible Drawbacks:**

* Metaprogramming in python is an edge skill, and often not the best way
to solve a problem. Messing around with things like this can often have
unintended consequences down the line.

* With PLXPR, wires will be restricted to be jax-tracable friendly

with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q:
    jax.core.eval_jaxpr(jaxpr.jaxpr, jaxpr.consts, 0.1)
q.queue
```
```
[X(0),
 IsingXX(0.1, wires=[0, 1]),
 Controlled(Adjoint(X(0)), control_wires=[1]),
 (0.5 * X(0)) @ Y(1) + Z(2)]
```

**Benefits:**

**Possible Drawbacks:**

* Metaprogramming in python is an edge skill, and often not the best way
to solve a problem. Messing around with things like this can often have
unintended consequences down the line.

* With PLXPR, wires will be restricted to be jax-tracable friendly
labels.

PennyLaneAI,pennylane,doc/releases/changelog-dev.md,"Make `Projector` jit compatible (#5595)

**Description of the Change:**

Add some jit-friendly logic to `BasisStateProjector` and
`StateVectorProjector`.

**Benefits:**

Projector is now jit compatible.

We might finally be able to move forward with #4969 if we ever actually
had time to do that.

**Possible Drawbacks:**

Not testing trainability, as it doesn't really make sense.

Could potentially be made more efficient.

### Before submitting

Please complete the following checklist when submitting a PR:

- [x] All new features must include a unit test.
If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add a test to
the
      test directory!

- [x] All new functions and code must be clearly commented and
documented.
If you do make documentation changes, make sure that the docs build and
      render correctly by running `make docs`.

- [ ] Ensure that the test suite passes, by running `make test`.

- [x] Add a new entry to the `doc/releases/changelog-dev.md` file,
summarizing the
      change, and including a link back to the PR.

- [x] The PennyLane source code conforms to
      [PEP8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
We check all of our code against [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/).
      To lint modified files, simply `pip install pylint`, and then

**Context:**
`dynamic_one_shot` creates n-shots tapes which is wasteful.

**Description of the Change:**
Create a single tape with a shot-vector which indicates to the device
how many times to repeat the tape execution.

**Benefits:**
For a tape like
```
dev = qml.device(""default.qubit"", shots=2000, seed=jax.random.PRNGKey(123))

@qml.qnode(dev, diff_method=None)
def func(x, y):
    qml.RX(x, wires=0)
    m0 = qml.measure(0, reset=False, postselect=1)
    qml.cond(m0, qml.RY)(y, wires=1)
    return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))


params = np.pi / 4 * np.ones(2)
```
The execution times are as follows (Latitude laptop):
- 12.7 s : vanilla Python
- 8.2 s : jax.vmap
- 11.1 s : jax.jit + jax.vmap + compilation
- 6.89 ms : jax.jit + jax.vmap

PennyLaneAI,pennylane,doc/releases/changelog-dev.md,"Fix a sorting order in parameter-shift terms (#5583)

**Context:**
Currently, `process_shifts` sorts shifts according to the absolute value
of the shift.
It uses `kind=""stable""`, which guarantees to keep inputs in their input
order if they have same absolute value.
While this is stable against repeated calls, the stable order is
somewhat arbitrarily depending on how a user/PennyLane
arrived at the input shifts. 

This is visible in `tests/gradients/core/test_general_shift_rules.py`,
where the expected output values sometimes have positive before negative
shifts with same magnitude, and sometimes the other way around.

**Description of the Change:**
This PR uses `lexsort`, which is like `argsort` but allows us to use the
sign of the shift as a secondary sorting key, producing not only stable
but also well-defined sorting results.

**Benefits:**
Predictable sorting results beyond the absolute value alone.

### Before submitting

Please complete the following checklist when submitting a PR:

- [x] All new features must include a unit test.
If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add a test to
the
      test directory!

- [x] All new functions and code must be clearly commented and
documented.
If you do make documentation changes, make sure that the docs build and
      render correctly by running `make docs`.

- [x] Ensure that the test suite passes, by running `make test`.

- [x] Add a new entry to the `doc/releases/changelog-dev.md` file,
summarizing the
      change, and including a link back to the PR.

- [x] The PennyLane source code conforms to
      [PEP8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
We check all of our code against [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/).
      To lint modified files, simply `pip install pylint`, and then
      run `pylint pennylane/path/to/file.py`.

When all the above are checked, delete everything above the dashed
line and fill in the pull request template.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Context:**
As a first step toward our goal to support `dynamic_one_shot` with
Catalyst, we attempt to support `jax.jit`.

**Description of the Change:**
Make all array shapes static. Perform post-selection as a filtering
operation during the post-processing step of `dynamic_one_shot`. Add
`jax.jit` tests. We also introduce the constant `fillin_value` which is
used as a placeholder for postselection mismatched samples.

PennyLaneAI,pennylane,doc/releases/changelog-dev.md,"Fix transforms that error with non-commuting measurements (#5424)

**Context:**

`tape.expand` will error out if the tape has any non-commuting
measurements present. But multiple transforms that don't care about
measurements at all use it to decompose to a target gate set. Even when
`expand_measurements=False`, `tape.expand` requires measurements to be
commuting, or composite observables. And this is a core behavior of
`tape.expand` that people might rely on. It's not as much a bug as a
problematic feature. AKA load-bearing bug.

Fortunately, we now have `qml.devices.preprocess.decompose`, which is a
transform that is capable of decomposing to a target gateset. While yes,
this transform is in the `devices` module, so using it is introducing a
cross-module dependency in a direction that we do not want, it gets the
job done. I would call this a sign that we should potentially consider
moving it into the `transforms` module and making it's import path more
accessible.

**Description of the Change:**

Use `decompose` instead of `tape.expand` in a variety of transforms.

**Benefits:**

These transforms now allow non-commuting measurements through.

**Possible Drawbacks:**

We still have other transforms still relying on `tape.expand`. But we
can investigate those another day.

Introducing a cross-module dependency in a direction we don't want a
dependency. This could be fixed by moving `decompose` to the transforms
module, but that is a problem for another day.

PennyLaneAI,pennylane,pennylane/transforms/optimization/merge_rotations.py,"Fix transforms that error with non-commuting measurements (#5424)

**Context:**

`tape.expand` will error out if the tape has any non-commuting
measurements present. But multiple transforms that don't care about
measurements at all use it to decompose to a target gate set. Even when
`expand_measurements=False`, `tape.expand` requires measurements to be
commuting, or composite observables. And this is a core behavior of
`tape.expand` that people might rely on. It's not as much a bug as a
problematic feature. AKA load-bearing bug.

Fortunately, we now have `qml.devices.preprocess.decompose`, which is a
transform that is capable of decomposing to a target gateset. While yes,
this transform is in the `devices` module, so using it is introducing a
cross-module dependency in a direction that we do not want, it gets the
job done. I would call this a sign that we should potentially consider
moving it into the `transforms` module and making it's import path more
accessible.

**Description of the Change:**

Use `decompose` instead of `tape.expand` in a variety of transforms.

**Benefits:**

These transforms now allow non-commuting measurements through.

**Possible Drawbacks:**

We still have other transforms still relying on `tape.expand`. But we
can investigate those another day.

Introducing a cross-module dependency in a direction we don't want a
dependency. This could be fixed by moving `decompose` to the transforms
module, but that is a problem for another day.

ProjectQ-Framework,ProjectQ,CHANGELOG.md,"Context Manager: with flushing(MainEngine()) as eng: (#449)

* Context Manager: with flushing(MainEngine()) as eng:

Simplify the creation, use, and flushing of any Engine using a Python context manager.

When exiting the `with` block, the engine is _automatically_ flushed.

Modeled after https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.closing
```python
from projectq import MainEngine, flushing  # import the main compiler engine
from projectq.ops import (
    H,
    Measure,
)  # import the operations we want to perform (Hadamard and measurement)

with flushing(MainEngine()) as eng:  # create a default compiler (the back-end is a simulator)
    qubit = eng.allocate_qubit()  # allocate a quantum register with 1 qubit

    H | qubit  # apply a Hadamard gate
    Measure | qubit  # measure the qubit

    # This line is no longer required... eng.flush()

print(f""Measured {int(qubit)}"")  # converting a qubit to int or bool gives access to the measurement result

* Add tests

* Run linters/formatters on code

* Fix isort comment pragmas

* Really fix isort issues in cengines/__init__.py

**Title:**
How to collect statistics of mid-circuit measurements

**Summary:**
PennyLane supports mid-circuit measurements not only to create dynamic
circuits with control flow using the measurement results, but also
supports a wide range of postprocessing options of the measured values.
This how-to explains the usage of `qml.measure` and briefly compares
`qml.defer_measurements` and `qml.dynamic_one_shot`. Then it shows how
(not) to measure qubit correlations with MCMs, and afterwards walks
through the supported postprocessing of MCM values and the allowed
return functions such as `qml.expval` or `qml.counts`.
Finally, ____ is shown as an application for obtaining statistics of
MCMs.

**Relevant references:**

**Possible Drawbacks:**

**Related GitHub Issues:**

----
If you are writing a demonstration, please answer these questions to
facilitate the marketing process.

* GOALS 闂 Why are we working on this now?

This how-to promotes mid-circuit measurement functionality in PennyLane,
which has been extended in recent releases. In particular, it contains a
comparison of the brand-new native MCM support via `dynamic_one_shot`
with `defer_measurements` and can serve to advertise this new feature.

In addition, this how-to is part of the broader goal of emphasizing MCMs
and dynamic circuits in our contents.

* AUDIENCE 闂 Who is this for?

Typical how-to audience: Fundamental concepts of measurements and
quantum computing are known, but the audience may not yet be familiar
with PennyLane's syntax for MCMs and returning their outcomes, or they
may want to consult this how-to as a reference of how to realize their
circuit with MCMs.
Anyone really with the goal of coding up a circuit that returns MCM
values can be in the audience.

PennyLaneAI,qml,demonstrations/tutorial_quantum_dropout.metadata.json,"Quantum dropout demo (#1003)

Hi! This demo request refers to [Issue
#4929](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/issues/4929) for
Pennylane, about implementing dropout for Quantum Neural Networks
directly in Pennylane.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Title:** 

Dropout for Quantum Neural Networks

**Summary:** 

In this demo we show how to exploit the quantum version of dropout
technique to avoid the problem of
overfitting in deep Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). What follows is
based on the paper

**Possible Drawbacks:**

In this demo, to show the effectiveness of the technique, dropout is
implemented by randomly setting some of the optimized parameters to 0 at
each iteration. Actual dropout should be implemented by substituting a
certain gate with the identity gate.

This technique (hence this demo) is for all people interested in Quantum
Machine Learning. Both researchers and enthusiasts may benefit by
learning from this demo how to avoid overfitting when using
overparametrized QNNs. We strongly believe that it will become a
standard for QML just like its classical counterpart in ML.

This commit removes the qiskit aer translation plugin. This was added as
a workaround for a Qiskit/qiskit#11351. This has been fixed in Qiskit
since 0.45.2 and is no longer necessary. The mechanism by which the
workaround worked was unsound in practice as it was mutating the target
and also explicitly using private attributes of the Target. This is
causing real issues now as it only worked by assuming the target wasn't
shared between passmanagers which is never guaranteed. Similarly the
reliance on internal private attributes of the Target class will cause
issues in the future when the target internals change (see
Qiskit/qiskit#12292). This commit opts to remove the plugin in its
entirity as it's no longer necessary and actively causing issues with
Qiskit 1.1 and transpiling targeting aer backends with >1 circuit. As
it's private internal detail there isn't a release note.

Qiskit,qiskit-aer,README.md,"Prepare for Qiskit 1.0 (#2047)

* Resolve CI dependencies in a single step and add qiskit==1.0.0rc1 job

This modifies the dependency-resolution steps to do their job in a
single step; Aer should have no dependencies pinning Qiskit, so we can
use the preferable form more eagerly.

This also adds a test run to the PR CI for Qiskit 1.0.0rc1 (or rc2, etc)
that always runs, so Aer doesn't regress.

Co-authored-by: Luciano Bello <bel@zurich.ibm.com>

* Fix test suite to work with Qiskit<1.0 and >=1.0

This commit *does not* touch the primitives, which appear to be broken
at a relatively basic level with Qiskit 1.0 - hopefully the primitives
team can fix that separately.

This modifies the test suite to work with both Qiskit 0.46 and 1.0.0rc1
simultaneously.  Unfortunately, some of the new-style fake backends
aren't in 0.46, so I just put in some import switches for my ease here.
A few tests, particularly in the noise model sections, were asserting
specific things about the properties/calibrations of Terra's fake
backends, which was quite fragile already, so in those particular cases
I replaced them with a manually constructed `Target` with properties
entirely under Aer's control.

microsoft,qsharp,compiler/qsc_frontend/src/compile/tests.rs,"Use hierarchical namespaces in name resolution (#1415)

_This PR replaces #1364_

This PR introduces a feature called _hierarchical namespaces_, a
module-like system that maintains backward compatibility. It is the
foundational groundwork that will pave the way for:
1. Naked namespaces (files without namespace declarations)
2. Package publishing and sharing
3. Explicit item imports
4. Exports and re-exports
5. and the rest of the stuff
[here](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/issues/493#issuecomment-1979722979)

Key changes include:
1. `VecIdent` type introduction: This abstraction over `Vec<Ident>`
represents the new namespaces in the AST. Alternate names could be
`DotIdent` or `Path`, but those names were already loaded with meaning
in our codebase. I'm open to feedback on nomenclature here.
7. `NamespaceId` usage: This replaces our previous flat map-style
`Rc<str> -> Res` item tracking.
8. `NamespaceTree`: This tracks the namespace hierarchy separately in
low-cost data structure, and allows us to keep our basic `tys` and
`terms` maps relatively untouched.
9. Name resolution algorithm update: The algorithm in `resolve.rs`
received a heavy facelift. Not only did I try to simplify the existing
code, but I also added the required functionality to check candidate
partially-opened or re-opened namespaces.

This PR maintains 100% backward compatibility with the existing
resolution engine, preserving features like re-opening namespaces,
shadowing semantics, merging namespaces via aliases, and absolute-path
opens. It also introduces the ability to reference a function in a
different namespace if its parent namespace is opened.

Additional notes:

1. Katas used a form of shadowing that wasn't tested in our compiler.
This PR [adds a
test](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp/pull/1312/files#diff-7a3aa16f18f6d132b9e54a6b6ebd53e6c3b41cea805c8f8db9c456b533a3c96bR2787)
for that.
2. Pursuing #1321 could help differentiate user-facing and
compiler-engineer-facing string representations of structs, which are
increasingly conflated.
3. There's potential for refactoring `ast`, `fir`, and `hir` to use
shared generic types, reducing duplicate `Ident`/etc types.
4. Completions functionality remains the same, but it's not yet aware of
the ability to partially open namespaces (e.g. `open Microsoft.Quantum`.
This will be addressed in future updates.
5. There is a performance regression, but we are performing a full
tree-traversal namespace resolution algorithm in a place where we used
to just do a constant table lookup. I have optimized this as much as I
believe is reasonable for now, bringing the regression down from ~40%,
where it was originally, to around 5-10% based on the benchmark run.

Also closes #1336

A previous change in the OpenVPN submodule tried to choose p256-sikep434 as a default if no ecdh-curve directive was present, and this worked because of a bug in OpenVPN that was fixed in v2.4.9. Instead of working around this, we return to OpenVPN's intended behavior, since the OQS fork of OpenSSL should eventually take charge of picking suitable defaults to only be post-quantum. Expand the comments in the sample configuration files to make it clear the ecdh-curve directive must be specified at least on the server to guarantee a post-=quantum key exchange."

* fix: use the symmetric formula for S^2

Prior to this fix, the `AngularMomentum` operator was working on the
assumption that the number of alpha-spin particles would always exceed
the number of beta-spin particles (for non-singlet systems). However,
this is not guaranteed to be the case. This commit fixes this problem by
using a symmetric formula for S^2 which is the average of the two cases
(alpha- vs. beta-spin particles exceeding the other).

* feat: log a warning when the alpha-beta overlap is non-unitary

When dealing with active spaces obtained from unrestricted-spin
orbitals, the alpha-beta overlap matrix which is used to construct the
S^2 operator can become non-unitary (for example, when the active set of
alpha- and beta-spin orbitals do not span the same space). This can
result in an <S^2> value measured on the active space that is largely
different from (e.g.) the UHF <S^2> value. More importantly, when this
is the case, the difference between these two <S^2> values is ""hidden""
in the inactive+inactive and inactive+active interactions. Especially
when spin contamination is present, this can lead to vastly unexpected
results and may indicate a poor choice of active space.

* UCC and fully occupied MOs (Fix for issue #1277)

The configuration check looked for whether any number of alpha or beta orbitals was greater or equals than the number of particles.
Obviously, there cannot be more particles than spin orbitals, and in order to handle this case, I updated the previous `any(n >= ...` to `any(n > ...`. 
For handling case where both alpha and beta are the same as the number of particles (i.e. He2 molecule), I created a new raise condition, notifying that the function is still not implemented.
For the case where either alpha or beta is equals to the number of particles (i.e. H-He molecule), it should just pass through.

* Added case for HeH
