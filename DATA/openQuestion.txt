Based on the above code change, what is the probable cause of why this code change was done?
What bugs does this code change resolve? Does this solve any classical or quantum vulnerabilities?
Code changes in qiskit, cirq, or dwave should be related to quantum bugs.
Is the code change related to classical or quantum computing?
What vulnerabilities (quantum or classical) does this fix solve?
What test case can be used to detect this bug or vulnerability in the original unchanged code?
Answer all the questions above, in short and strictly under the following six different topics:
Probable Symptom, Description,  Bug Type (classical or quantum, one word answer),
Bug Pattern (categorize the type of bug or code change, 5 to 6 words answer),
Vulnerability (10 words max), and
Test Case (30 words max, if only applicable).
Do not return numbered lists.
Do not write topic titles. Strictly separate one topic from the other by a pipe "|" symbol.
