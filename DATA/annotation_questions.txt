What is the probable cause for this code change?
Describe the code change briefly (issue and impact).
Is the code change classical or quantum or hybrid (one word answer)?
What is the pattern of bug/issue reported (for example dependency, logic, environment, functionality etc.)?
What classical or quantum vulnerability does this fix solve? Code changes in qiskit, cirq, or dwave should be related to quantum bugs. If no bugs are resolved then write "None"?
What test case can be incorporated to test this fix?
